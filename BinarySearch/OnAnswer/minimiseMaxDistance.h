// Minimise Maximum Distance between Gas Stations
// Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array ‘arr’ of length ‘n’,
//  which contains positive integer positions of ‘n’ gas stations on the X -
// axis.You are also given an integer ‘k’.You have to place 'k' new gas stations on the X
//- axis.You can place them anywhere on the non - negative side of the X - axis,even on non -
// integer positions .Let 'dist' be the maximum value of the distance
// between adjacent gas stations after
// adding k new gas stations.Find the minimum value of ‘dist’.
